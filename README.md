Added 2 two classes to solve the first two problems

To run and check the solutions,please checkout the project 
and comment/uncomment the pieces of codes in the main class
to check the solutions separately.

For the first problem,of making an array unique and finding 
the minimum sum , the test input can be added in the code itself
just modify the elements added to array list "a"

The Second one takes input from user when run, 
Provide the number of instruction lines that are to be given in 
the first line, then give each subsequent instruction by hitting 
enter(to go the next line)
